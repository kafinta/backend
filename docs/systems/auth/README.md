# Authentication System

## Overview
The authentication system provides secure user authentication and authorization for the application. It implements Laravel's built-in authentication features with additional customizations for enhanced security and user experience.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. User Registration
```php
POST /api/auth/register
{
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "password_confirmation": "string"
}
```

### 2. User Login
```php
POST /api/auth/login
{
    "email": "string",
    "password": "string"
}
```

### 3. Token Management
- Access tokens are issued upon successful login
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when valid
- Tokens can be revoked manually or automatically expire

## Key Features

### Security
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure session management
- Token-based authentication

### User Management
- User registration with email verification
- Password reset functionality
- Account deactivation
- Session management
- Role-based access control

### Token System
- JWT-based authentication
- Token refresh mechanism
- Token revocation
- Automatic token expiration

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- Laravel Framework
- Laravel Sanctum (for API authentication)
- Laravel Mail (for email verification)

### Development Dependencies
- PHPUnit (for testing)
- Laravel Dusk (for browser testing)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
AUTH_DRIVER=sanctum
TOKEN_EXPIRY=3600
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=604800
```

### Security Settings
- Password minimum length: 8 characters
- Password requirements: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Maximum login attempts: 5
- Lockout duration: 15 minutes

## Best Practices
1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
3. Use secure password hashing
4. Implement proper session management
5. Regular security audits
6. Keep dependencies updated

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. Token expiration
   - Solution: Implement refresh token mechanism
2. Rate limiting
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff
3. Session management
   - Solution: Use secure session configuration

## Next Steps
1. Review the [API Documentation](api.md) for detailed endpoint information
2. Check the [Frontend Integration Guide](frontend.md) for implementation details
3. See the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for planned features and improvements
